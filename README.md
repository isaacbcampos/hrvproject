Development of a prototype for measuring sustained attention in the classroom through heart rate variability
The prototype was developed around 1 Arduino Uno added 1 pulse sensor and 1 shield sd card.
This schedule aims record intervals interbeats in cardiac signal in milisecongs through sd card to posterior analysis.
We tested in 27 students and has been shown to fulfill its purpose in addition to being affordable, inexpensive and user-friendly.
